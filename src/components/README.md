# Components

This directory contains all React components organized by type and purpose.

## Structure

- **`ui/`** - Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- **`layout/`** - Layout-related components (header, footer, navigation, etc.)
- **`forms/`** - Form components and form-specific logic
- **`features/`** - Feature-specific components that combine ui and business logic

## Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all components
- Export components from index files for clean imports
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files)
