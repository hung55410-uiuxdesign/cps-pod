# Lib

This directory contains shared utilities, types, constants, and business logic.

## Structure

- **`utils/`** - Utility functions (formatting, validation, etc.)
- **`hooks/`** - Custom React hooks
- **`types/`** - TypeScript type definitions
- **`constants/`** - Application constants and configuration
- **`validations/`** - Schema validation (Zod, Yup, etc.)
- **`api/`** - API client and related utilities

## Guidelines

- Keep functions pure and testable
- Export everything through index files
- Use proper TypeScript types
- Document complex utility functions
- Group related functionality together
